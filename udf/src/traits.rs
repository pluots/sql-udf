/// Implement this on a struct that is desired to carry data between calls to,
/// `init`, `process`, `clear`, `add`, and `remove`. If there is no data to be
/// shared, it may be zero-sized (e.g. `struct MyFunc{}`).
///
/// If the UDF is only basic, the process is:
///
/// - Call the `init(...)` function to perform setup and validate arguments
/// - Call the `process(...)` function to create a result from those arguments
///
/// The UDF specification also calls out a `deinit()` function to deallocate any
/// memory, but this is not needed here (this wrapper and Rust handles this for
/// you).

    /// Allowed number types are `i64` (integer types), `f64` (real types), and

    /// Anything else is assumed to be a string type (SQL string or decimals)
    /// and must fulfill `AsRef[u8]`. _Usually_ this is a string type (`&'static

    ///
    /// - Check that arguments are the proper type
    /// - Check whether the arguments are const and have a usable value (can
    ///   provide some optimizations)
    ///
    /// # Errors
    ///
    /// If your function is not able to work with the given arguments, return a
    /// helpful error message explaining why. Max error size is
    /// `MYSQL_ERRMSG_SIZE` (512) bits, and will be truncated if any longer.
    ///
    /// `MySql` recommends keeping these error messages under 80 characters to
    /// fit in a terminal, but personal I'd prefer a helpful message over
    /// something useless that fits in one line.
    ///
    /// Error handling options are limited in all other functions, so make sure
    /// you check thoroughly for any possible errors that may arise, to the best
    /// of your ability. These may include:
    ///
    /// - Incorrect argument quantity or position
    /// - Incorrect argument types

    /// see thrown around a lot. They are lifetime annotations and more or less
    /// say, "`self` lives at least as long as my return type does so I can
    /// return a reference to it, but `args` may not last as long so I cannot

/// This trait must be implemented if this function performs aggregation.
///
/// The basics of aggregation are simple:
///
/// - `init` is called once per result set (same as non-aggregate)
/// - `clear` is called once per group within the result set, and should reset
///   your struct
/// - `add` is called once per row in the group, and should add the current row
///   to the struct as needed
/// - `process` is called at the end of each group, and should produce the
///   result value for that group
///
/// # Aggregate Error Handling
///
/// Error handling for aggregate functions is weird, and does not lend itself to
/// easy understandability. The following is my best understanding of the
/// process:
///
/// - Any aggregate function may set a nonzero error (Represented here in return
///   value by `Err(NonZeroU8)`). The value is not important, can be something
///   internal
/// - These errors do not stop the remaining `add()`/`remove()` functions from
///   being called, but these functions do receive the error (and so may choose
///   to do nothing if there is an error set)
/// - Errors are not reset on `clear()`; you must do this manually (Hence
///   `error` being mutable in this function signature)
///
/// In order to enforce some of these constraints, we use `NonZeroU8` to
/// represent error types (which has the nice side effect of being optimizable).
/// Unfortunately, it is somewhat cumbersome to use, e.g.: `return
/// Err(NonZeroU8::new(1).unwrap());`

    /// this function may choose to reset it (that is probably a good idea to
